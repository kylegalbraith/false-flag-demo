name: Battery Depot CI Demo
overview: A 5-10 minute live investor demo where an AI agent writes a real code change in the false-flag-demo repo and validates it against real CI in seconds using Depot CI's local-first loop (uncommitted changes, scoped jobs, custom snapshot image), never pushing a broken commit. The arc is built to directly answer Battery's four questions: dynamic workflows, intelligence about which validation loops to run, how the caching layer enables it, and why this is different from every push-triggered CI on the market.

# Battery Series B Demo: Depot CI as the Agentic "Verification Substrate"

## What Battery actually asked (and how we answer it)

Their email reads as word soup, but it decomposes into four concrete questions. The demo is structured so each beat answers one:

- **"Dynamic workflows"** -> the agent authors and runs a CI workflow on the fly, in a language it already knows (GitHub Actions YAML), scoped to exactly the change it made.
- **"Intelligence around which validation loops to run"** -> the agent inspects the workflow, picks only the relevant job(s) with `--job`, and reruns only what failed instead of re-running the world.
- **"How your caching layer works to enable this"** -> a pre-baked Depot CI snapshot image (`.depot/workflows/snapshot-e2e.yml`) + Depot Cache means every loop starts warm in seconds, not from a cold `apt-get`/`pnpm install`/`go mod download`.
- **"How this is different from alternatives"** -> Depot CI runs your *uncommitted local diff* via API/CLI in seconds. Every other CI (GHA, CircleCI, Buildkite) is push-triggered and a black box. This is "push-wait-guess" vs. a local closed loop.

The one-line story (already drafted in [.demo/DEMO.md](.demo/DEMO.md)): *an agent validates its own uncommitted code against real CI in seconds, reads the failure programmatically, fixes it, reruns only the failed job, and pushes once green, having never pushed a broken commit.*

## The loop we are demonstrating

  edit["Agent edits code<br/>(uncommitted)"] --> run["depot ci run --job ...<br/>(local patch, no push)"]
  run --> warm["Warm snapshot image<br/>+ Depot Cache"]
  warm --> result{green?}
  result -->|no| logs["depot ci logs<br/>read failure"]
  logs --> ssh["optional: depot ci run<br/>--ssh-after-step N"]
  ssh --> edit
  logs --> edit
  result -->|yes| push["push once,<br/>never red"]
```

Everything below already exists in the repo or is a small, low-risk addition. We are not building a new product; we are wiring the existing `false-flag-demo` codebase into a tight, reproducible agent loop.

## Assets already in the repo (leverage these)

- [.depot/workflows/snapshot-e2e.yml](.depot/workflows/snapshot-e2e.yml) - builds the custom CI base image (`d58mfwccbf.registry.depot.dev/falseflag-ci-base:...`) baking Go 1.26, Node 22, pnpm, Spectral, Playwright + Chromium, and the Postgres image via `depot/snapshot-action`. **This is the visual proof of "your caching layer."**
- [.depot/workflows/ci.yml](.depot/workflows/ci.yml) - the migrated 16-job baseline (lint, test-go, test-go-race, test-js, build-js, conformance, contract-test, build-images, image-scan, smoke, dashboard-e2e). Jobs run on `depot-ubuntu-latest` and the custom image; `dashboard-e2e` already shards 6x and `lint`/`dashboard-e2e` already consume the snapshot image.
- [.depot/workflows/lint.yml](.depot/workflows/lint.yml) - shows `runs-on: { size: 4x16, image: <snapshot> }` + parallel steps; good to point at for "right-sized, warm sandbox."
- [depot.json](depot.json) - project `mr31tm4wc4`; CLI is installed (`depot v2.101.63`).
- Remote is `Zagrit-HQ/false-flag-demo`, working branch `kyle-demo-main`.

## Pre-staged live code change (deterministic failure)

To keep a *live* demo reliable, pre-rehearse one specific change that produces a clean, self-inflicted failure the agent can diagnose and fix:

- The flag evaluation engine has a Go implementation in [internal/eval/predicates.go](internal/eval/predicates.go) and a byte-identical TypeScript twin (cel-lite) under `js/packages/sdk-js`. A cross-runtime "conformance" corpus is asserted by **both** runtimes (`internal/eval/cross_runtime_test.go`, `internal/sdkgo/conformance_test.go`, and the JS `conformance` test). `make conformance` runs both halves.
- **The demo task:** ask the agent to add a new string operator (e.g. `starts_with`) to the flag targeting language, plus a corpus fixture that uses it.
- **The deterministic failure:** if the agent implements the Go side first (natural order), the `conformance` / cross-runtime job fails because the TS twin doesn't know the operator yet -> a real, repo-grounded mismatch, not a contrived `exit 1`. The agent reads the log, adds the TS implementation, reruns just that job, green.
- This is honest (it's a genuine consequence of the dual-runtime design) and 100% reproducible on stage.

## Prep checklist (do before the call)

1. **Confirm Depot CI access**: `depot login` (or `DEPOT_TOKEN`), and confirm the Depot Code Access GitHub App is installed on `Zagrit-HQ/false-flag-demo` (`depot ci migrate preflight`).
2. **Ensure the snapshot image is fresh**: trigger [.depot/workflows/snapshot-e2e.yml](.depot/workflows/snapshot-e2e.yml) once so the warm image exists in the registry (it is `workflow_dispatch`). This is also a great thing to *show* as "the agent baked its dependencies once."
3. **Install the agent loop harness** (pick Cursor as primary since it's the live IDE, keep Claude Code as backup - both are tiny):
   - Cursor: `.cursor/commands/fix-ci.md` (the run/status/logs/ssh loop) + `.cursor/cli.json` with `{"permissions":{"allow":["Shell(depot)"]}}`.
   - Install Depot skills so the agent has the full CLI reference: `npx skills add depot/skills`.
4. **Author the "dynamic" agent workflow** `.depot/workflows/agent-validate.yml`: a small workflow that uses the snapshot image and runs only `conformance` + `test-go` (the checks relevant to an eval-engine change). Present this on stage as "the agent writes a validation loop scoped to its own change." Keep it pre-written but uncommitted so it looks freshly generated; optionally let the agent generate it live if rehearsal is solid.
5. **Rehearse the exact change** (the `starts_with` operator) end to end 2-3 times; capture a screen recording as the fallback.
6. **Warm the cache**: run the conformance/test-go jobs once before the call so Depot Cache and the snapshot image are hot and the on-stage loop is seconds.
7. **Reset to a clean tree** on `kyle-demo-main` right before starting.

## Run-of-show (5-10 minutes, live)

### 0. Cold open - the problem (~45s, talk only)
"Every CI today is push-wait-guess. You commit a hypothesis, push, wait 15-20 minutes, squint at logs. That's death for an agent doing 30 iterations an hour." Show the 16-job [.depot/workflows/ci.yml](.depot/workflows/ci.yml) scrolling - "this is a real pipeline: Go, TS, Postgres + SQLite matrices, Playwright sharded 6x, image scans. Normally a black box."

### 1. The substrate / caching layer (~1 min)
Open [.depot/workflows/snapshot-e2e.yml](.depot/workflows/snapshot-e2e.yml). "Step one: the agent baked every heavy dependency - Go, Node, pnpm, Playwright + Chromium, Postgres - into one Depot CI snapshot image, once." Then show [.depot/workflows/lint.yml](.depot/workflows/lint.yml) `runs-on: { image: <snapshot> }`. "Every validation loop now boots from this warm image. That's the caching layer that makes the inner loop fast enough to matter."

### 2. Agent writes code (~1 min)
In Cursor, prompt the agent: *"Add a `starts_with` string operator to the flag targeting engine and a corpus fixture that uses it."* It edits [internal/eval/predicates.go](internal/eval/predicates.go) (+ config wiring + a fixture). Leave it **uncommitted**. "No commit. No push. This is just my working tree."

### 3. Local-first validation, scoped (~2 min) - the centerpiece
Agent runs (via the `/fix-ci`-style loop):
```bash
depot ci run --workflow .depot/workflows/ci.yml --job conformance
```
"It uploaded my *uncommitted diff* as a patch and ran it on real CI. No other CI on the market does this." It fails (Go has the operator, TS twin doesn't). Agent reads it programmatically:
```bash
depot ci status <run-id>
depot ci logs <run-id> --job conformance
```
Agent fixes the TS twin (cel-lite) locally, then reruns only the failed work:
```bash
depot ci run --workflow .depot/workflows/ci.yml --job conformance
```
Green. "It reran *only* the job that mattered - intelligence about which validation loop to run - and it took seconds because the sandbox was warm."

### 4. (Optional, high-impact) Open the hood (~1 min)
If time and nerves allow, show the differentiator no other CI has:
```bash
depot ci run --workflow .depot/workflows/ci.yml --job conformance --ssh-after-step 2
depot ci ssh <run-id>
```
`pwd`, `ls` - "the agent can stand on the actual machine and check reality instead of guessing from logs."

### 5. Dynamic workflow on the fly (~1-1.5 min) - answers "dynamic workflows"
Reveal `.depot/workflows/agent-validate.yml` (the scoped workflow). "The agent wrote its own validation loop, in GitHub Actions YAML it already understands, using the cached image, running only the checks its change touches."
```bash
depot ci run --workflow .depot/workflows/agent-validate.yml
```
Green in seconds.

### 6. Push once, never red (~30s)
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "feat(eval): add starts_with operator" && git push
```
Show the same workflow now running as a GitHub check on the PR. "It pushed exactly once, already green. It never pushed a broken commit."

### 7. The "why us" close (~45s)
Land the verification-substrate framing:
- API/CLI-driven, runs *uncommitted local diffs* -> the only CI that fits inside an agent's inner loop.
- Pre-warmed sandboxes + snapshot images + Depot Cache -> seconds, not minutes; the agent isn't re-running the world on every typo fix.
- Same workflow runs locally and in CI -> zero drift between "what the agent checked" and "what gates the PR."
- Everyone else is push-triggered and opaque. As agents write more code, the bottleneck moves from writing to *verifying* - and Depot is the verification substrate that makes agentic engineering safe and fast.

## Risk management / fallbacks
- Keep a **screen recording** of a clean run-of-show as the hard fallback.
- Have `depot ci run list` / dashboard open in a tab to show prior green runs if a live run is slow.
- Pre-warm caches right before the call (step 6 of prep).
- If networking/SSH is flaky, skip beat 4 (it's optional).
- Keep the agent task small and rehearsed; do not improvise a new feature live.

## Deliverables to produce when we execute (out of plan-mode)
- `.cursor/commands/fix-ci.md` + `.cursor/cli.json` (or `.claude/` equivalents).
- `.depot/workflows/agent-validate.yml` (scoped dynamic workflow).
- A rehearsed diff for the `starts_with` operator (Go + TS + fixture), staged but reverted before the live run.
- A short `.demo/DEMO.md` expansion documenting the run-of-show and exact commands.
